we use select,groupby,having,orderby clauses
select is uesd to reterive the coloumn that which the user needs for execution
where is used for reterving of the rows from the database table
example :
create table emp(
empid int PRIMARY KEY,
empname varchar(20),
empdept varchar(20)
);

insert into emp (empid,empname,empdept)values(1,'sreeja','it');
insert into emp (empid,empname,empdept)values(2,'priya','cse');
insert into emp (empid,empname,empdept)values(3,'kalyan','cyber');
insert into emp (empid,empname,empdept)values(4,'nani','devops');
insert into emp (empid,empname,empdept)values(5,'sandeep','AWScloud');
select * from emp;
select empname ,empdept from emp
where empid=3;
select empdept from emp
where empname ='sandeep';


Now using in and between functions :
IN:Used to filter values matching a specific set of discrete values.
BETWEEN: Used to filter values within a continuous range
-- Get employees whose dept is either IT or CSE
select empname from emp where empdept in('it','cse');
select salary from emp where empname in('kalyan','nani');
--Get employee whose salary is in between 35 to 55
select empname,salary from emp where salary between 3500 and 5500;LIKE
LIKE :Used for pattern matching in strings (text columns).
Often used with wildcards:
%,_ 
select empname from emp where empname like('s%');//starting with alphabet s
select empname from emp where empname like('%s');//ending with s
select empname from emp where empname like('%s%');//in between s
